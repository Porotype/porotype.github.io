Porotype is a collection of add-ons, tutorials and examples about web applications, mostly focusing on stuff regarding [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com), [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) and Java, with the occasional odd topic.

Porotype is mainly a personal work-related outlet of <a href="https://twitter.com/marcenglund">@marcenglund</a>, though contributions are more than welcome.
